            Hi there, I'm Emily! This is the home page of my website, which contains an 'About Me' section! My favourites are listed in the subpage titled 'My Favs' above, and the subpage 'Gallery' is a link to the page where I've put some cool photos that I've either taken, my family has, or of places that are special to me!

        <p class="about-me">
            I am a year 10 student at Wakatipu High School. You can often find me reading a good book or doing some form of exercise or sport. My extra- and co-curricular activities include artistic swimming, rock climbing, strength class, swimming, netball, Ngā Ara Wai (Kapa Haka), and Waka Ama. Recently, I attended the 2025 Artistic Swimming New Zealand South Island Regional Championships in Selwyn, and came home with two gold medals and a first place ribbon. The photos below, however, are from the year before when we hosted the 2024 Regionals here in Queenstown! I got the same results then; 1st in the combo, duet and figures.
